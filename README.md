# Spectral-CT-Thesis
Thesis

This project is related to a thesis in Spectral CT. All files in dataStructures and named something with ct_data or PhantomGen4D were developed by Wail Mustafa back in 2018. 

Additions to Wail's work was first made by Miguel Bento Bustorff, and later heavily modified by me to fit the goals of this project. 

The goals was to perform a benchmark of several CT reconstruction methods, in order to determine the best performance.
